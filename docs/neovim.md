## Installation

### Dependencies

For this custom neovim configuration work properly, you should install the
following dependencies on your machine (I've put some Arch packages links to help):

- Git [extra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/git)
- Packer (for Packer) [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvim-packer-git)

- Xclip (for clipboard remap) [extra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xclip/)

## Plugins (WIP)

Here's a list of plugins I use and a brief description for each:

- [wbthomason/packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim): plugin manager for Neovim.
It is unmaintained. Must be changed to [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
soon.
- [tpope/vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): a Git plugin for Vim.
Allow calling Git commands from inside Neovim and some additional commands for
higher level operations.
- [nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim):
Fuzzy finder over lists, especially to navigate through files.
- [theprimeagen/harpoon](https://github.com/theprimeagen/harpoon): quick tool to add and
navigate through vim marks. Very quick to keep changing from one file to another.
