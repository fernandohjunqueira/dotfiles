# dotfiles

Neovim, i3, tmux and zsh.

Basic setup for my personal use.
Focused on high productivity.

Feel free to use, share or suggest.

Heavily inspired on [ThePrimeagen dotfiles](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles) and [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Installation

For now, I'm using the classic workaround with symlinks.

Just create a symlink for each file or directory you would like to install:

```sh
ln -s <source> <destination>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you type absolute paths for `source` and `destination` to avoid problems.
